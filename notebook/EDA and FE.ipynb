    "## PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main goal of this project is to perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on\n",
    "the Zomato Dataset and build an appropriate Machine Learning Model that will help\n",
    "various Zomato Restaurants to predict their respective Ratings based on certain\n",
    "features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DATASET INFORMATION\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- The recorded data for each restaurant and each category was read and data for each restaurant was scraped individually. 15 variables were scraped in this phase. For each of the neighborhood and for each category their online_order, book_table, rate, votes, phone, location, rest_type, dish_liked, cuisines, approx_cost(for two people), reviews_list, menu_item was extracted. See section 5 for more details about the variables.\n",
