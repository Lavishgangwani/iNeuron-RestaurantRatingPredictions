This project predicts restaurant ratings in Bangalore using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

This repository contains the code for predicting restaurant ratings in Bangalore using various machine learning models. The project involves data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and deployment of a web application for user interaction.

## Libraries Used

The project relies on several Python libraries, all of which are listed in `requirements.txt`. To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: Numerical operations on arrays and matrices.
- `seaborn`, `matplotlib`: Data visualization libraries.
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning toolkit for data mining and analysis.
- `xgboost`: Gradient boosting library for optimized distributed gradient boosting.
- `flask`: Micro web framework for building web applications in Python.
- `dill`: Serialization library for Python objects.
