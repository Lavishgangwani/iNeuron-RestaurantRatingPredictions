# Sensor Fault Detection with Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for implementing sensor fault detection using machine learning techniques. Sensor fault detection is crucial in various industries, including manufacturing, automotive, aerospace, and more, where accurate sensor readings are essential for ensuring safety, reliability, and efficiency.

## Features

- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms for sensor fault detection.
- Preprocessing techniques for handling missing data, outliers, and noise in sensor readings.
- Evaluation metrics and visualization tools for assessing model performance.
- Deployment strategies for integrating fault detection models into real-time systems.

## Dataset

We utilize a publicly available dataset [provide link or description of the dataset] containing sensor readings under normal operating conditions as well as instances of sensor faults. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

## Dependencies

- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- [additional dependencies]

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lavishgangwani/sensor-fault-detection.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to explore the data, preprocess it, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

## Usage

- **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of sensor readings, identify anomalies, and gain insights into potential features for fault detection.
- **Preprocessing**: Implement preprocessing techniques such as missing data imputation, outlier detection, and feature scaling to prepare the data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines) on the preprocessed data to learn patterns associated with normal and faulty sensor readings.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and visualize their performance using confusion matrices, ROC curves, etc.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the trained models into production environments for real-time sensor fault detection, considering factors such as computational efficiency and latency constraints.
